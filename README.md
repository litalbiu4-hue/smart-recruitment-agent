The primary recruitment report.

Contains:

* Candidate ID
* Candidate Name
* Email
* Position
* Recruitment Score
* Recruitment Status
* Interview Date
* Interview Time
* Calendar Status
* Calendar Event
* Invitation Status
* Invitation Sent Date

---

### interview_candidates.xlsx

Contains only candidates selected for interviews.

Information includes:

* Candidate Name
* Position
* Interview Date
* Interview Time
* Calendar Status
* Invitation Status
* Invitation Sent Date

---

### gmail_summary.txt

Provides a summary of each recruitment cycle.

Includes:

* Total Candidates
* Duplicate Emails Removed
* Highest Score
* Average Score
* High Priority Candidates
* Interview Candidates
* Review Candidates

## Error Handling

The project includes comprehensive exception handling.

Handled situations include:

* Missing required files.
* Gmail API connection errors.
* Google Calendar API failures.
* Claude API connection errors.
* Authentication errors.
* Missing permissions.
* Keyboard interruption.
* Unexpected runtime exceptions.

Whenever an unexpected error occurs, the workflow stops safely to prevent inconsistent data.

---

## Duplicate Prevention

The system includes several duplicate prevention mechanisms.

### Candidate Processing

Duplicate candidate email addresses are automatically removed before report generation.

---

### Interview Scheduling

Before creating a Google Calendar event, the system:

* Checks calendar availability for the requested time slot.
* Verifies whether the candidate already has a scheduled interview.
* Sends a conflict notification email if the slot is unavailable.

If an interview already exists, the candidate is skipped.

---

### Invitation Delivery

Before sending an invitation email, the system verifies:

* Calendar Status
* Invitation Status

If an invitation has already been sent, no additional invitation is generated.

---

## Calendar Conflict Detection

The Interview Scheduler includes a full calendar conflict detection mechanism.

### How It Works

Before creating each interview event, the system:

1. Calculates the proposed interview time slot.
2. Queries Google Calendar for existing events in that time slot.
3. If the slot is available — creates the interview event.
4. If the slot is occupied — sends a conflict notification email to the candidate.

### Conflict Notification Email

When a conflict is detected, the system automatically sends a notification email to the affected candidate informing them that the interview could not be scheduled at the requested time and that the HR team will contact them to arrange an alternative.

### Weekend-Aware Scheduling

The system automatically skips Friday and Saturday when scheduling interviews.

### 7-Day Advance Scheduling

All interviews are scheduled at least 7 days in advance from the date the workflow is executed.

---

## Claude LLM Integration

The Recruitment Agent uses Claude AI to extract candidate information from natural free-text emails.

### How It Works

1. The system reads unread emails from Gmail.
2. Each email is sent to Claude API for analysis.
3. Claude extracts candidate information from the free-text content.
4. The extracted data is used for candidate evaluation and scoring.
5. After processing, the email is marked as read.

### Benefits

* Handles natural language emails without rigid formatting.
* Extracts information accurately from varied email styles.
* Eliminates the need for structured email templates.
* Demonstrates real-world AI integration.

---

## Validation

Before executing any workflow, the system validates:

* Required project files.
* Authentication files.
* Project modules.
* Input files.

Only after successful validation does the workflow continue.

---
