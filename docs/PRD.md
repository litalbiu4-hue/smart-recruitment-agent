# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name

**Smart Recruitment Agent – AI-Powered Recruitment Automation System**

---

## Project Purpose

The Smart Recruitment Agent is an end-to-end recruitment automation system developed to streamline and automate the candidate recruitment process.

The system simulates candidate applications, processes incoming Gmail messages, evaluates applicants according to predefined business rules, schedules interviews in Google Calendar with conflict detection, sends interview invitation emails, and generates recruitment reports.

The project demonstrates workflow automation through the integration of multiple Google services and Python-based business logic.

## Business Problem

Recruitment teams spend a significant amount of time performing repetitive administrative tasks such as:

* Reading candidate applications.
* Evaluating applicant qualifications.
* Ranking candidates.
* Scheduling interviews.
* Sending interview invitations.
* Maintaining recruitment reports.

Manual processing increases workload, introduces delays, and may result in inconsistent decision-making.

The Smart Recruitment Agent automates these repetitive tasks, allowing recruiters to focus on candidate selection rather than administrative work.

* Create Google Calendar interview events.
* Send interview invitation emails automatically.
* Generate Excel recruitment reports.
